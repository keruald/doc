INTRODUCTION

Keruald is an open source modular library to build web engines.

It's lite, non intrusive and let the developer code as he wants its engine or
site.

Keruald is not targetted to directly build a site with. If it's what you seek,
see Pluton if you want a content-oriented site and Xen if you prefer a MVC.

Keruald is more a starter kit than a framework, meaning you're not going to
keep it updated like you would do with products like Drupal. You can so edit it
widely freely. Remember, it's your application.

LICENSE

(c) 2010, Sébastien Santoro aka Dereckson
Keruald is released under BSD license.

You'll find the rationale for the BSD license at the following URL:

INSTALLATION STEPS

The www folder is the root web folder.

i.   create a database and import doc/sql/minimal-keruald-schema.sql

ii.  edit www/includes/config.php

iii. it's installed, you can now review and edit www/index.php

If you add a lot of fields to users table, it's faster to regenerate user.php
with PlutonScaffolding, a TCL script to generate model classes. You'll find the
template in doc/scaffold folder.

AUTO INSTALL

We don't provide autoinstaller, as Keruald is not targetted to final users.

If you want to contribute one, you're welcome. Note a shell script is maybe a
better approach than a PHP one.

If you want to create one for your application, have a look to the Xen one.
It asks database, URL, site and features information and then builds index.php
and includes/config.php (yes, the Xen index.php is generated by the installer,
that avoid to have if blocks everywhere to load or not a library).
